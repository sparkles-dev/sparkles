# Sparkles

> Examples for Spark Java Microframework

This repository contains a collection of code examples demonstrating a web tech stack built entirely on open source.

## Preface

All examples are my personal **resolution** of what I found productive and production-ready and reliable and responsible.
No dilutions and no restraints as it doesn't matter **what** you do.
It matters **how you get there**.

Drawbacks of adopting this technology stack:

 - I like wasting hours reading source code on GitHub in the web browser
 - I like frustration about minimalism and missing features
 - I like to write glue-code
 - I like to feel responsible
 - When the world goes bust, I try again and try a little better

Reasons for this technology stack:

 - I feel calm and serene with the above limitations.
